## Why ai-ding?

You run `claude` and wait... and wait... 10 minutes later you realize it finished 5 minutes ago. Or worse — it's asking you a question and you didn't notice.

**ai-ding alerts you the instant your AI assistant needs your attention:**

- When it **finishes responding** — with a summary of what it said
- When it **asks you a question** — so you can answer immediately
- When it **needs permission** — no more missed approval dialogs
- When it's **waiting for your input** — never miss a prompt again

## Supported Channels

| Channel | macOS | Linux | SSH | Config Required |
|---------|:-----:|:-----:|:---:|:---------------:|
| **Desktop** | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | None |
| **Sound** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | None |
| **Telegram** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Bot token |
| **Slack** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Webhook URL |
| **Bark** (iOS) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Device key |
| **Server酱** (WeChat) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | SendKey |
| **ntfy.sh** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Topic URL |
| **Email** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | SMTP credentials |

Sound + desktop work out of the box. Enable more channels in `~/.ai-ding.yaml`.

## Quick Start

### As a Claude Code plugin (recommended)

```
/plugin marketplace add qinsz01/ai-ding
/plugin install ai-ding@qinsz01
```

That's it. You'll get notifications automatically when Claude finishes, asks a question, or needs permission.

### As a CLI tool

```bash
npm install -g ai-ding
ai-ding --init    # Create ~/.ai-ding.yaml
ai-ding --test    # Test all enabled channels
```

### As a Codex plugin

ai-ding now supports Codex in both repo-local and personal-install setups.

#### Repo-local setup

If you cloned this repository, it already includes the required Codex files:

- `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` to expose the plugin in the workspace marketplace
- `.codex/hooks.json` to send Stop-event notifications from the repo's `dist/cli.js`

Open the repo in Codex, enable hooks in `~/.codex/config.toml` if needed:

```toml
[features]
codex_hooks = true
```

Then restart Codex and install `ai-ding` from `/plugins` if you want the `notify` skill in chat. Repo-level Stop notifications work through `.codex/hooks.json`.

#### Personal install

If you installed `ai-ding` globally with npm, run:

```bash
ai-ding --install-codex
```

This will:

- copy the plugin source to `~/.codex/plugins/ai-ding`
- update `~/.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`
- write `~/.codex/hooks.json`
- enable `features.codex_hooks = true` in `~/.codex/config.toml`

Restart Codex afterward. Automatic Stop notifications will work immediately; install `ai-ding` from `/plugins` if you also want the `notify` skill inside Codex chat.

To remove the personal setup:

```bash
ai-ding --uninstall-codex
```

## Usage

```bash
# Send a notification (auto-detects environment)
ai-ding "Build complete"

# With a custom title
ai-ding --title "CI Pipeline" "All tests passed"

# Send to a specific channel only
ai-ding --channel telegram "Deploy failed"

# Disable specific channels
ai-ding --no-desktop --no-sound "Silent alert"

# Test all configured channels
ai-ding --test

# Initialize config file
ai-ding --init

# Install personal Codex integration
ai-ding --install-codex

# Remove personal Codex integration
ai-ding --uninstall-codex
```

### Output

Every invocation prints per-channel results so you know exactly what happened:

```
[ai-ding] ✓ sound: terminal bell
[ai-ding] ✓ telegram: sent to chat 1234...
[ai-ding] ✓ slack: sent to Slack webhook
[ai-ding] Done: 3 sent.
```

If a channel fails, it shows the error:

```
[ai-ding] ✓ sound: terminal bell
[ai-ding] ✗ telegram: HTTP 401: Unauthorized
[ai-ding] Done: 1 sent, 1 failed.
```

### Smart Notifications (Plugin Mode)

#### Claude Code

When installed as a Claude Code plugin, ai-ding sends contextual notifications:

| When | Notification |
|------|-------------|
| Claude finishes responding | Summary of the last message |
| API error occurs | "API Error: rate_limit: 429 Too Many Requests" |
| Claude asks a question | The question text |
| Plan needs approval | "Plan ready for your approval" |
| Claude needs permission | "Permission needed: Bash" |
| Claude waits for input | "Claude is waiting for your input" |
| Other notifications (errors, etc.) | Forwards the notification message |

Subagent activity (Explore, code-reviewer, etc.) is **not** notified — only main agent actions that require your attention.

#### Codex

In Codex, ai-ding uses the official `Stop` hook and sends the last assistant message at the end of each turn. That means:

- completed-task summaries are notified automatically
- questions are still surfaced, because the final assistant message is forwarded
- repo-local hooks work from this repository's `.codex/hooks.json`
- personal installs work through `ai-ding --install-codex`

Codex does **not** currently expose the same hook events Claude Code does for plan approval, permission prompts, or separate notification categories, so those extra Claude-only notifications are not available in Codex.

## Configuration

Edit `~/.ai-ding.yaml`:

```yaml
channels:
  desktop:
    enabled: true
  sound:
    enabled: true
    file: null           # Optional: path to custom audio file
  ntfy:
    enabled: false
    url: "https://ntfy.sh/your-topic"
  telegram:
    enabled: false
    bot_token: ""
    chat_id: ""
  bark:
    enabled: false
    url: "https://api.day.app"
    device_key: ""
  serverchan:
    enabled: false
    sendkey: ""
  slack:
    enabled: false
    webhook_url: ""
  email:
    enabled: false
    smtp_host: ""
    smtp_port: 587
    from: ""
    to: ""
    user: ""
    password: ""

remote:
  fallback_order:
    - sound
    - ntfy

defaults:
  message: "Task completed"
  title: "ai-ding"
```

### Environment Variables

Override any config value with `AI_DING_*` environment variables:

| Variable | Config Path |
|----------|-------------|
| `AI_DING_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` | `channels.telegram.bot_token` |
| `AI_DING_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` | `channels.telegram.chat_id` |
| `AI_DING_SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` | `channels.slack.webhook_url` |
| `AI_DING_NTFY_URL` | `channels.ntfy.url` |
| `AI_DING_BARK_URL` | `channels.bark.url` |
| `AI_DING_BARK_DEVICE_KEY` | `channels.bark.device_key` |
| `AI_DING_SERVERCHAN_SENDKEY` | `channels.serverchan.sendkey` |
| `AI_DING_EMAIL_SMTP_HOST` | `channels.email.smtp_host` |
| `AI_DING_EMAIL_SMTP_PORT` | `channels.email.smtp_port` |
| `AI_DING_EMAIL_FROM` | `channels.email.from` |
| `AI_DING_EMAIL_TO` | `channels.email.to` |
| `AI_DING_EMAIL_USER` | `channels.email.user` |
| `AI_DING_EMAIL_PASSWORD` | `channels.email.password` |

Environment variables take precedence over the YAML config file.

## SSH & Remote Setup

When you're connected via SSH, desktop notifications won't reach your local machine. ai-ding uses a progressive fallback:

1. **Terminal bell (`\a`)** — zero config, but may not work through tmux
2. **ntfy.sh** — push notification to your phone/browser, one URL to configure (recommended)

### Enabling Terminal Bell Over SSH

Your local terminal decides whether `\a` produces a sound. Here's how to enable it:

| Terminal | How to enable |
|----------|---------------|
| **Windows Terminal** | Open `settings.json`, add to profile: `"bellStyle": "audible"` or `"bellStyle": "all"` |
| **iTerm2** (macOS) | Preferences → Profiles → Terminal → check "Audible bell" |
| **macOS Terminal** | Preferences → Profiles → Advanced → check "Audible bell" |
| **VS Code Terminal** | Add to settings: `"terminal.integrated.enableBell": true` |
| **PuTTY** | Configuration → Terminal → Bell → set to "Play default sound" |
| **tmux** | Add to `~/.tmux.conf`: `set -g bell-action any` |

> **Note:** Terminal bell through tmux over SSH is unreliable. If you're using tmux, we strongly recommend setting up ntfy.sh instead.

### Setting Up ntfy.sh (Recommended for SSH)

ntfy.sh is the most reliable way to get notifications over SSH. No account, no app install required on the server.

**Step 1:** Pick a unique topic name: `my-dev-notifications-a1b2c3`

**Step 2:** Subscribe on your device:
- **Phone**: Install [ntfy app](https://ntfy.sh) ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ntfy/id1625396347) / [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.heckel.ntfy))
- **Browser**: Open `https://ntfy.sh/your-topic-name` and allow notifications

**Step 3:** Configure:

```yaml
channels:
  ntfy:
    enabled: true
    url: "https://ntfy.sh/my-dev-notifications-a1b2c3"
```

Or via environment variable:

```bash
export AI_DING_NTFY_URL="https://ntfy.sh/my-dev-notifications-a1b2c3"
```

## How It Works

```
Notification request
  │
  ├─ Local desktop?
  │    ├─ Yes → Desktop notification + Sound
  │    └─ No (SSH/CI) → Fallback chain:
  │         ├─ Terminal bell (\a) — zero config
  │         └─ ntfy.sh push — one URL
  │
  └─ Parallel: Telegram / Bark / Slack / Email
               (always fire if enabled, regardless of environment)
```

## FAQ

<details>
<summary>Does it work over SSH?</summary>

Yes. Terminal bell (`\a`) works over SSH with no configuration. For reliable notifications, we recommend setting up ntfy.sh — it sends push notifications to your phone/browser with just a URL.
</details>

<details>
<summary>What works without any configuration?</summary>

Sound and desktop notifications work immediately after `npm install -g ai-ding`. No config file needed. For more channels (Telegram, Slack, etc.), run `ai-ding --init` and edit `~/.ai-ding.yaml`.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I use multiple channels at once?</summary>

Yes. All enabled channels fire in parallel. You can have desktop + sound + Telegram + email all going off at the same time.
</details>

<details>
<summary>How is this different from cc-notify?</summary>

cc-notify is a Tauri desktop app (Rust + React). ai-ding is a lightweight Node.js CLI — install in seconds, no GUI needed. ai-ding also supports China-specific channels (Server酱, Bark) and works as both a Claude Code and Codex CLI plugin.
